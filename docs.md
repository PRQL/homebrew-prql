# State
 - [x] **Formula created:**
 - The initial formula has been created, it contains the basic structure. Now It has to be defined every part in it.
 
 - [x] **Dependencies checked**
 - Thanks to cargo, the only dependency needed for homebrew is Rust (`depends_on "rust" => :build`).
 This command tells Homebrew that the *Rust* formula is needed and it's gets installed. 
 the `:build` hash indicates that is a build-time only dependency.
 Then, with Rust (and cargo installed) the `cargo build` command will take care of the inner-rust-dependencies of prql.
 
 - [x] **Install defined:**
 - The install definition has been created. For now It just build the crate from `cargo build --release --bin prql`. 
 **- - release:** Build optimized artifacts with the `release` profile.
 **- - bin:** A target selection. Build the specified binary. 
 - **`bin.install "target/release/prql"`** is used to move the bin generated by `cargo build` (which is in `target/release/prql`) to the `*homebrew directory*/Cellar/prql/*version*/bin` and make it executable (`chmod 0555 prql`).
 

 - [ ] **OS availables**
